Decompose each step in the user\\'s request into a further subdivision of multiple steps, in a super granular way.\\r\\n        The more granular the task is broken the better the results will be.\\r\\n        You should decompose them in a way as to fit every sub-step as a node in the GenSphere project.\\r\\n        \\r\\n        IMPORTANT: GenSphere currently does not support conditional nodes, where the flow execution changes if \\r\\n        a condition is satisfied or not. For instance, if you create a node that validates another node\\'s output, \\r\\n        it won\\'t be possible to change the flow execution depending on the answer. So it\\'s better to avoid checking \\r\\n        for conditions on nodes for now. \\r\\n        \\r\\n        1. For each step, when an LLM API call is needed, check if you need to search the web or scrape a URL. \\r\\n           If so, Tavily is a good option for search and Firecrawl is good for scraping (Firecrawl is useful when \\r\\n           you know the exact URL to scrape).

For instance, if you create a node that validates another node\\'s output, \\r\\n        it won\\'t be possible to change the flow execution depending on the answer.

For instance, if you search informations about a subject,\\r\\n        the URL might be that of a news channel, not a URL associated to the subject.\\r\\n        OBS4: Write the yaml file, functions, and schemas file explicitly, without omissions, in a ready-to-copy-paste way for deployment.\\r\\n        OBS5: Double-check that when a node references another node, they are compatible with each other. For instance,\\r\\n              the output of an llm_service node is always a string (or a Pydantic Schema), so write your nodes and functions  \\r\\n              taking that into account. \\r\\n        OBS6: When referencing other nodes\\' outputs in a node, remember to always use GenSphere\\'s syntax `node_name.output_name`.\\r\\n              You cannot reference just `output_name`. In order to comply with GenSphere\\'s syntax, all node output references must be preceded\\r\\n              by the corresponding node name: `node_name.output_name`.\\r\\n        OBS7: If the output of a node is a Python list, you can use the syntax `node_name.output_name[i]` to execute the node\\r\\n              for every element of the list, and then collect outputs as a Python list.\\r\\n              However GenSphere syntax does not support accesing attributes or methods after we write \\'[i\\'].\\r\\n              For instance: \\r\\n              `node_name.output_name[i].some_attribute` will fail\\r\\n              `node_name.output_name[i].some_method()` will fail\\r\\n              After `[i]`, you **cannot** call other methods or access attributes.\\r\\n              If that happens in the code, you need to correct. A way to correct can be by doing further preprocessing\\r\\n              on a node output before passing it to other node.\\r\\n        OBS8: If a node should process text, you **should** use an llm_service node for that, not function_call node. \\r\\n        OBS9: For llm_service nodes, always use `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` as model.\\r\\n        OBS10: llm_service nodes **cannot** have both `structured_output` and `tools` defined at the same time. \\r\\n        OBS11: don\\'t assume you can import schemas in schema.py into functions.py. They should be totally independent.\\r\\n        OBS12: Notice that, when structured_output is used in an llm_service node, the output of that node \\r\\n        will be a pydantic model instance as defined in the scemas file. To access any attribute from that object,\\r\\n        you should first recursively convert pydantic models to dictionaries using the \\'.model_dump()\\' from pydantic.\\r\\n        IMPORTANT OBS12: While writing functions or schemas, ensure there is no placeholder code. You should write\\r\\n        everything for production, there will be no further refinement by anyone else. \\r\\n        After you finish, double-check if you are indeed following GenSphere\\'s syntax correctly, and that\\r\\n        nothing is missing or incorrect. \\r\\n\\r\\n        Given the above, rewrite yaml, functions, and schemas files explicitly, without omission or boilerplate code. \\r\\n        Make any corrections if needed, in order for the code to run as expected. This will go to production.\\r\\n\\r\\n    outputs:\\r\\n      - qa_gensphere_files\\r\\n\\r\\n  - name: extract_gensphere_files\\r\\n    type: llm_service\\r\\n    service: openai\\r\\n    model: \"gpt-4o-2024-08-06\"\\r\\n    structured_output_schema: GenSphereFiles\\r\\n    params:\\r\\n      prompt: |\\r\\n        You are an expert software developer on GenSphere, a declarative framework to build LLM applications.\\r\\n        For reference, this is the full documentation and source code of genflow.py, yaml_utils.py, and utils.py: \\r\\n\\r\\n        {{ get_gensphere_docs.gensphere_docs }}\\r\\n\\r\\n        A software engineer was tasked with writing GenSphere files for a project, and his output was the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n        {{ create_gensphere_files.gensphere_files }}\\r\\n        \\r\\n        A more senior software engineer reviewed the code, and his output was: \\r\\n        \\r\\n        {{ qa_gensphere.qa_gensphere_files }} \\r\\n\\r\\n        Your task is to output exactly the correct GenSphere files (yaml file, functions file, and schemas file), \\r\\n        and only that, based on the corrected output.
